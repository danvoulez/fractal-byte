# CHANGELOG — Addendum ingestion (2026-02-13T125512Z)

**User request**: “ADICIONE ESTA E A ULTIMA MENSAGEM COMO DOCS E ARQUIVOS AO ZIP DO RUNTIME”.

**Action**:
- Added `docs/runtime-ghost-write-ahead.md` with canonical definitions for Ghost Records and Write-Ahead/Write-After.
- This changelog records the intent to include both the spec and the instruction in the runtime distribution zip.

Notes:
- Future PR should wire schemas and tests referenced by the addendum if not already present.
